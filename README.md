# Bug Bounty Platform

A microservices-based bug bounty platform built with Go, enabling secure bug reporting and bounty management.

## Overview

This platform connects security researchers with organizations through a streamlined bug bounty process. Built using microservices architecture, it demonstrates modern Go development practices including gRPC communication, event-driven patterns, and secure payment handling.

## Architecture

The platform consists of three core microservices:

- **Auth Service** - Handles user authentication, authorization, and profile management
- **Bounty Service** - Manages bug reports, bounty lifecycle, and claim processing
- **Wallet Service** - Processes payments, escrow management, and fund transfers

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go 1.21+
- **API**: gRPC and REST
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (local) / Kubernetes (production)
